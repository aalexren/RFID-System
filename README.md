#### Assignment 1 SSAD Course



##### **Assignment requirements:**

Your team will be given the topic for a project with description, your task is to implement ONE of the design patterns:

- Factory method
- Abstract factory
- Prototype
- Singleton

You are not required to develop the project (for example, if the project is about to create an Android app, then it does not mean that you have to create an Android project. It means you should just take into account the aspects of mobile development when you are creating your classes). It is about implementing the design pattern within the context of the project. You may choose any feature (functionality) of your project, and if you think that the description does not contain a feature to implement the design pattern, you are free to add a feature to the project within the context of the topic.
